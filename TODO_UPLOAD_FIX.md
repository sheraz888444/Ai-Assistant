# File Upload Fix - ✅ RESOLVED

## Issue Status: FIXED ✅

**Problem Solved:**
The file upload workflow was previously split between two separate pages:
- CustomizePage.jsx handled image upload
- CustomizeName.jsx handled name input
- This caused confusion and incomplete data submission

**Solution Implemented:**
✅ **Combined SetupProfile.jsx**: Single page now handles both name and image upload
✅ **Unified Form Submission**: Both fields submitted together in one request
✅ **Direct Navigation**: Users go straight to dashboard after successful setup
✅ **Redundant Code Removed**: CustomizeName.jsx deleted to eliminate confusion
✅ **Routing Updated**: App.jsx cleaned up to remove old references

## Technical Details:
- FormData sends both `assistantName` and `image` in single POST request
- Backend validates both fields before marking setup as complete
- User model properly stores both name and image path
- Error handling covers all edge cases

## Testing Results:
✅ Complete user flow tested: Registration → Setup → Dashboard
✅ File upload functionality verified
✅ Form validation working correctly
✅ Error messages display properly
✅ Navigation flow is smooth and intuitive

## Files Modified:
- `frontend/src/pages/SetupProfile.jsx` - Enhanced with combined functionality
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` - Routing cleaned up
- `backend/controllers/userController.js` - Already had proper handling
- `CustomizeName.jsx` - Removed as redundant

**Status: Issue completely resolved and tested. No further action needed.**
